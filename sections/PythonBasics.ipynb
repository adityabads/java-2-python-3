The difference comes from `x / y` in the two programs. In Java, the division operator has different behaviors based on the type of the data: if the data on both sides are ints, then it will use integer division, otherwise it will use regular division. Python always does regular when you use the `/` operator (to avoid those annoying int division bugs). If you want to do integer division, you have to write the code as follows to use the integer-division operator `//`:"
